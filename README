# Document Processing System

## Overview

This project is designed to automate the process of handling, extracting, and processing documents. It integrates various services, such as AWS Textract, OpenAI, Dropbox, Nextcloud, and Paperless NGX, to extract metadata, process document contents, and store the results. The system is flexible and configurable via environment variables, allowing easy customization for different workflows.

## Features

- **Document Upload & Storage**: Upload documents to S3 and manage them with Dropbox and Nextcloud.
- **OCR Processing**: Use AWS Textract to extract text from scanned documents.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Automatically extract key information using OpenAI's API.
- **Document Management**: Store processed documents and metadata in Paperless NGX for easy retrieval.
- **IMAP Integration**: Fetch documents from multiple IMAP email accounts for processing.

## Environment Variables

The project is configured through the `.env` file, where you define credentials and settings such as:

- AWS access keys for Textract
- Dropbox and Nextcloud credentials
- Paperless NGX API token
- IMAP settings for fetching documents
